* PI GPIO Benchmarks

This repository contains benchmarking code in various languages to
measure IO performance of the raspberry pi.

** Propeller Setup

I use the Pimoroni Propellerhat. Pin A0 is connected to BCM
GPIO24. The =blink.spin= contains a simple .5Hz rectangle waveform
generator.

Use =build.sh blink= to compile & upload to the HAT.
